        <p>Hello Guys, Today I want to sing a poetry :-</p>
        <p>📚 "The Tale of Alakh Pandey (Physics Wallah Style)"
In a world of formulas, fierce and grand,
Came a teacher with chalk in hand.
With hoodie swag and fearless flair,
He taught Newton’s laws with style and care.

“Bacchon!” he’d shout, with energy bright,
“Today we’ll make your concepts right!”
From gravitation to waves and sound,
His voice made knowledge go BOOM all around.

He’d jump, he’d sketch, he’d dance, he’d spin,
Explaining torque with a goofy grin.
While boards would groan and markers squeak,
His brain would run at lightning peak!

With coffee in one hand, passion in both,
He made students take the NEET-JEE oath.
“Focus karo beta, distractions hatao!
Iss baar selection lekar hi aana yaaro!”

His diagrams? Wavy but wise indeed,
His jokes? Random, but plant the seed.
From memes to mocks, he’d bring the fire,
Turning physics into pure desire.

So here’s to Alakh, our guide supreme,
The star of every science dream.
Not just a teacher — a movement, a brand,
Who made even inertia feel so in demand!</p>
